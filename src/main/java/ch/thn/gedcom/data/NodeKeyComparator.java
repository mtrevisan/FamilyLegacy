		 * -----------------------------
		 *
		 * When looking for an entry with containsKey, it searches
		 * for that key only in a range which makes sense. For example in the
		 * map with the following ordering by OrderString:
		 *
		 * 02SEX
		 * 03INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE
		 * 07SPOUSE_TO_FAMILY_LINK
		 * 17CHANGE_DATE
		 *
		 * When looking for SEX using only the string SEX (comparing the keys
		 * without the ordering), it starts comparing with SPOUSE_TO_FAMILY_LINK
		 * (which gives a negative number with compareTo), then it compares
		 * INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE (which gives a positive number with compareTo).
		 * The switch from the negative compareTo result to the positive result
		 * indicates that SEX must be between those two other entries (since it
		 * is a sorted list) and it stops looking. This results in containsKey
		 * returning FALSE when looking up SEX.
